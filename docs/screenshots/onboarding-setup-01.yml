context: >
  Onboarding/check-in screen with multiple question sections stacked
  vertically. Each section has a question label, then selectable chip
  options in a wrap layout. Some chips are selected (highlighted with
  accent border/fill). Sections are separated by thin dividers.
  Numeric input fields for exercise and sleep duration at the bottom.
  A "Save" CTA button at the bottom of the screen.

elements:
  - id: "multi-section-layout"
    what: "Vertically stacked question sections with chip selections"
    like: >
      The presentation flow is well-structured — each question occupies
      its own section, separated by dividers, with selectable options
      displayed as chips in a wrapping layout. The progression from
      top to bottom feels natural. Multiple questions fit on one
      screen without scrolling, which keeps the onboarding feeling
      fast and lightweight.

      Use this multi-section layout pattern for MaxReps onboarding
      screens that collect multiple data points. Stack question sections
      vertically with clear dividers between them. Use selectable chips
      for categorical choices (e.g. training goals, experience level,
      available equipment). Keep sections compact enough to fit 3-4
      questions per screen.

  - id: "selectable-chips"
    what: "Wrap-layout chips with selected/unselected states"
    like: >
      The chips wrap naturally across multiple lines and have clear
      visual states — selected items are highlighted while unselected
      remain muted. The "+" chip at the end allows adding custom
      options. The interaction model is simple: tap to toggle.

      Implement selectable chip components for onboarding choices.
      Use a flex-wrap layout so chips flow naturally across lines.
      Define clear selected (accent border + fill) and unselected
      (muted border, no fill) states using Tamagui tokens. Include
      a "+" chip for user-defined additions where relevant.

  - id: "numeric-input"
    what: "Compact numeric input with unit label"
    like: >
      The numeric inputs (60 minutes, 8 hours) are compact inline
      fields with the unit displayed as a label next to the input.
      Clean and fast to interact with — no modals or pickers needed.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use compact inline numeric inputs for onboarding data like
      training frequency, session duration, years of experience.
      Display the unit label next to the input field. Keep inputs
      minimal — small bordered box with the number, unit as adjacent
      text.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The multi-section, single-screen approach to onboarding is the key
  pattern here. Collecting several data points on one screen with
  clear visual separation keeps the flow fast. The chip-based
  selection is intuitive and space-efficient for categorical choices.

avoid: >
  The font styling is weak — section titles lack visual hierarchy
  and don't stand out enough from the option chips. For MaxReps,
  ensure question/section titles have strong typographic weight
  (larger size, bolder weight) to clearly separate them from the
  selectable options. The chip texture and border style (thin gold
  outlines) feels dated — use our Tamagui design tokens for a more
  modern chip treatment.
