context: >
  Explore screen from a travel app showing a search bar overlaid on
  an illustrated cityscape header. The search bar features a colored
  magnifying glass icon (purple) with the search query text. Below,
  horizontal filter chips for content categories and a card-based
  content feed.

    what: "Search bar with colored magnifying glass icon"
    like: >
      The search bar has a subtle but effective design detail: the
      magnifying glass icon uses an accent color instead of the
      default grey. This small touch makes the search bar feel more
      intentional and branded. The icon draws the eye to the search
      input without being distracting.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Apply an accent color to the magnifying glass icon in our
      exercise search bar. Use our primary brand color from Tamagui
      tokens for the icon while keeping the input text and placeholder
      in standard neutral tones. This adds a touch of personality to
      an otherwise utilitarian component.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  A small design detail — coloring the search icon — can elevate a
  standard search bar and reinforce brand identity. Worth adopting as
  a subtle polish element across all search inputs in MaxReps.

avoid: >
  The specific purple color used here is not relevant. Use MaxReps'
  own brand accent color. Do not replicate the illustrated header
  or the overall layout of this screen — only the search bar accent
  detail is of interest.
