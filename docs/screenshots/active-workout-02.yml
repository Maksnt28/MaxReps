  Workout template creation/editing screen for a "Full Body Workout"
  with 10 exercises and 25 sets. Two exercises visible: Ab Roller
  (timed sets at 0:30) and Squat (rep-based sets at 10 reps). Each
  exercise displayed as a card with inline set rows, plus options
  for superset and adding sets.

elements:
  - id: "exercise-card"
    what: "Card-based exercise block with inline set editing"
    like: >
      Each exercise lives in its own card container with clear
      boundaries. The layout is clean and easy to manipulate — exercise
      name and category at the top, then set rows below. The card
      pattern makes it obvious where one exercise ends and the next
      begins.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use card containers for each exercise block in workout creation
      and editing views. Each card should have: exercise header (name +
      category), inline set rows, and action buttons (superset, add set)
      at the bottom of the card. Use Tamagui card tokens for consistent
      styling.

  - id: "set-row-layout"
    what: "Horizontal set row with weight and reps/time fields"
    like: >
      Each set is a single horizontal row with clear input fields for
      weight (kg) and reps or time. The layout is intuitive and easy
      to edit inline. The fire icon for set status and the minus button
      for deletion are well-placed.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Adopt this horizontal set row structure for workout editing.
      Each row: status indicator, weight input with unit label, reps
      or time input with unit label, delete button. Support both
      rep-based and time-based set types within the same view.

  - id: "workout-header"
    what: "Workout title with exercise/set count summary"
    like: >
      The header shows the workout name with a subtitle summarizing
      total exercises and sets (e.g. "10 exercises, 25 sets"). Gives
      an instant overview of workout volume without scrolling.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Include an exercise and set count summary below the workout
      title in template editing views. Update this count dynamically
      as exercises and sets are added or removed.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The card-based exercise layout is clear and easy to interact with.
  The inline set editing with horizontal rows is the right pattern
  for workout creation. However, this screen lacks important
  information for a complete training overview — there's no indication
  of target muscle groups, rest periods, or exercise notes that would
  help the user understand the full picture of their workout plan.

avoid: >
  The small exercise thumbnail images (Ab Roller, Squat illustrations)
  don't add much value and feel like wasted space. For MaxReps, avoid
  inline exercise thumbnails in the editing view — instead, indicate
  muscle groups through colored tags or chips which are more space-
  efficient and informative.
