  Workout overview screen for a "Chest, Back, Abs" session. Shows
  three small anatomical muscle group thumbnails with 100% completion
  indicators, an "Add an exercise" button, a warm-up section, and
  exercise cards with thumbnails (Dumbbell Fly, Dumbbell Bench Press).
  A superset section groups related exercises. "Start Workout" CTA
  button at bottom right.

    like: >
      The row of small muscle group illustrations at the top is
      excellent. Each thumbnail highlights a specific muscle area
      (chest, back, abs) with a percentage indicator below. It gives
      an instant visual understanding of which body parts the workout
      targets without taking up too much space.

      Implement a compact row of muscle group indicators at the top
      of workout and program overview screens. Use small stylized
      body outline thumbnails with highlighted muscle areas and
      optional intensity/volume indicators. Keep them small and
      horizontally scrollable if needed. Use our Tamagui color tokens
      to color-code each muscle group consistently.

    like: >
      Each exercise shows its key parameters on one line below the
      name: "4 sets • 15 reps • 12.5 lb". This dot-separated format
      is very scannable and gives all essential info at a glance.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use this compact summary format for exercise rows in program
      and workout overview screens. Display: exercise name as primary
      text, then "X sets • Y reps • Z kg" as secondary text. Use
      dot separators for readability.

  - id: "superset-grouping"
    what: "Visual grouping of exercises into a superset block"
    like: >
      The superset section clearly groups related exercises together
      with a label ("Superset") and round count ("4 ROUNDS"). Makes
      the workout structure immediately understandable.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Support visual superset grouping in workout views. Use a
      distinct container or indent to group superset exercises, with
      a label and round count. This is a future feature but the UI
      pattern should be considered in the card layout system design.

takeaway: >
  The muscle group thumbnail row at the top is the standout element.
  It solves the problem of showing workout targeting at a glance
  without cluttering the exercise list. This is the best approach
  seen so far for muscle visualization — small, compact, informative,
  and not intrusive.

avoid: >
  The exercise photo thumbnails (actual photos of someone performing
  the exercise) are large and take up significant vertical space.
  For MaxReps, prefer compact illustrations or icons over real photos
  in list views to save space and maintain a cleaner aesthetic. The
  dark theme with red accents is specific to Fitbod's brand — do not
  replicate this color scheme.
