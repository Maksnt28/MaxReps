  New workout creation screen. Shows an exercise card for "Weighted
  Planks" with a brand logo, a table-style set editor (SET, REPS,
  WEIGHT columns), an "Add Set" button, and a "Create Superset"
  option. A drag handle at the top of the card suggests reordering.
  Two action buttons at the bottom: "Add Exercises" and "Save Workout".

    like: >
      The overall structure is a useful reference: exercise displayed
      as a card with a drag handle for reordering, set data presented
      in a table format with column headers (SET, REPS, WEIGHT), and
      dual action buttons at the bottom for adding exercises or saving.
      The "Create Superset" option is positioned at the card level.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use this as a structural reference for the MaxReps program
      builder. Key patterns to note: drag handle at top of exercise
      cards for reordering, tabular set layout with clear column
      headers, "Add Set" button within each exercise card, superset
      creation option at card level, and dual bottom actions (add
      more vs save). Adapt the visual treatment to match MaxReps
      design tokens.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  A baseline reference for workout/program builder screens. The
  structure is functional but the visual execution is not inspiring.
  The key structural elements (drag handle, tabular sets, card-level
  actions, bottom dual CTAs) are worth noting for MaxReps program
  builder architecture.

avoid: >
  The typography is unappealing — heavy uppercase throughout feels
  rigid and unfriendly. The dark input fields within the dark card
  create poor contrast and readability. The overall aesthetic is
  too dark and monochromatic. For MaxReps, ensure input fields have
  clear contrast against card backgrounds, and use a mix of font
  weights for better hierarchy rather than relying on uppercase.
