  Analytics overview screen with tab navigation (Overview, Discovery,
  Audience), time range pills (7 Days, 30 Days, 90 Days), summary
  stat cards in a horizontal row, a large key metric in accent color,
  and an area chart with dual data series (Starts as dashed line,
  Streams as solid line with filled area). Interactive data point
  with date tooltip on touch.

    what: "Dual-series area chart with interactive tooltip"
    like: >
      The chart is visually elegant — a smooth area fill with gradient
      opacity under the primary line, a secondary dashed line for
      comparison, and an interactive touch point that shows the exact
      date and value. The chart feels premium with its smooth curves
      and subtle gradient fill. The legend below is simple and clear.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use this chart style for MaxReps progression graphs. Smooth
      line with gradient area fill in accent color for the primary
      metric (e.g. weight lifted, estimated 1RM). Optional dashed
      line for comparison data (e.g. previous period, target).
      Interactive touch: show exact date, value, and exercise details
      on tap. Include a simple legend when multiple series are shown.
      Use a charting library that supports smooth curves and gradient
      fills (e.g. react-native-chart-kit or victory-native).
    priority: high

takeaway: >
  The chart presentation is the sole focus here. The smooth area
  chart with gradient fill, interactive data points, and dual-series
  comparison is the gold standard for MaxReps progression
  visualization. This level of chart polish elevates the entire
  stats experience.

avoid: >
  The summary stat cards at the top are horizontally scrollable and
  partially cut off on the left — ensure MaxReps stat cards are
  fully visible without horizontal scrolling. The purple accent color
  is Spotify-specific.
