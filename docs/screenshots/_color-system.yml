# CORE PRINCIPLE
# =============================================================================
principle: >
  The interface is 95% monochrome (black, grey, silver, white).
  Color appears ONLY to carry a specific meaning. The user learns
  instinctively: blue = active, green = progressing, red = regressing,
  gold = record, white/black = neutral completion.

  When a color appears, it signals something. When there is no color,
  nothing requires attention. This creates a natural visual hierarchy
  driven entirely by meaning.

# =============================================================================
# BLEU ÉLECTRIQUE — Interactive / Active
# =============================================================================
blue_electric:
  meaning: "This element is active, interactive, or requires attention NOW"
  tokens:
    dark: "#3B82F6"
    light: "#2563EB"

  used_on:
    - element: "Timer countdown digits"
      reason: "The timer is the most time-sensitive active element"
    - element: "Timer progress ring"
      reason: "Visual reinforcement of countdown"
    - element: "Timer +30s button"
      reason: "Interactive action directly related to the timer"
    - element: "Current set row background tint"
      reason: "Identifies which set is being logged right now"
    - element: "Current set number"
      reason: "Reinforces active set identification"
    - element: "Current set weight value"
      reason: "The primary data the user is about to log"
    - element: "CTA button (Valider · Série X/Y)"
      reason: "Primary action — always in accent"
    - element: "Session duration badge"
      reason: "Active session indicator"
    - element: "Progress dots (completed segments)"
      reason: "Shows session advancement"
    - element: "Done/todo separator line"
      reason: "Separates completed sets from upcoming"
    - element: "Accent bar on timer card"
      reason: "Identifies the timer card as active"
    - element: "Timer bandeau background tint"
      reason: "Distinguishes timer from content cards"

  never_on:
    - "Exercise names"
    - "Muscle group chips"
    - "Section headers"
    - "Completed set checkmarks"
    - "Delta values (those use green/red)"
    - "PR celebrations (those use gold)"
    - "Static labels and metadata"
    - "Column headers"

# =============================================================================
# VERT — Progression
# =============================================================================
green_progress:
  meaning: "You are performing better than last time"
  tokens:
    dark: "#34E8A0"
    light: "#18905A"

  used_on:
    - element: "Positive delta values (+2.5 kg, +1 rep)"
      reason: "Direct indication of improvement vs last session"
    - element: "Momentum bar positive fill"
      reason: "Global session performance indicator"
    - element: "Momentum positive percentage"
      reason: "Numeric confirmation of improvement"
    - element: "PR card delta value (↑ +2.5 kg)"
      reason: "Quantifies the record improvement"
    - element: "Progress chart line and fill"
      reason: "Historical trend visualization"

  never_on:
    - "Completed set checkmarks (completion ≠ progression)"
    - "Exercise names or labels"
    - "CTA buttons"
    - "Timer elements"
    - "Muscle group chips"
    - "Any decorative element"

  critical_distinction: >
    Green means MEASURED IMPROVEMENT versus a previous reference
    point. Simply completing a set is not progression — it's just
    completion. That's why checkmarks are neutral white/black.

# =============================================================================
# ROUGE — Regression / Attention
# =============================================================================
red_regression:
  meaning: "Performance decreased or attention is needed"
  tokens:
    dark: "#FF5A6A"
    light: "#D93D4A"

  used_on:
    - element: "Negative delta values (−1 rep, −2.5 kg)"
      reason: "Direct indication of regression vs last session"
    - element: "Momentum bar negative fill"
      reason: "Global session regression indicator"
    - element: "Momentum negative percentage"
      reason: "Numeric confirmation of regression"
    - element: "Destructive actions (delete set, cancel workout)"
      reason: "Warning that action is irreversible"

  never_on:
    - "Failed sets (a failed set at same weight is neutral, not red)"
    - "Timer expiry (timer uses blue, not red urgency)"
    - "Error states unrelated to performance"
    - "Any decorative element"

# =============================================================================
# OR — Personal Record
# =============================================================================
gold_pr:
  meaning: "A new personal record has been achieved"
  tokens:
    dark: "#FFD700"
    light: "#B89800"

  used_on:
    - element: "PR label text"
      reason: "Immediate identification of record"
    - element: "Accent bar on PR card"
      reason: "Card-level celebration — gold bar at top"
    - element: "Trophy emoji accompaniment"
      reason: "Universal symbol of achievement"

  never_on:
    - "Any element that is not a confirmed personal record"
    - "Near-PRs or personal bests that don't break the record"
    - "CTA buttons"
    - "Timer elements"

  note: >
    Gold is the rarest color in the interface. It only appears when
    a genuine record is broken. This rarity makes it celebratory.

# =============================================================================
# BLANC / NOIR — Neutral Completion
# =============================================================================
neutral_completion:
  meaning: "Task done. No performance judgment attached."
  tokens:
    dark_check_bg: "#E8E8EA"
    dark_check_fg: "#0A0A0E"
    light_check_bg: "#131316"
    light_check_fg: "#FFFFFF"

  used_on:
    - element: "Completed set checkmark"
      reason: "The set is done — that's all. Not good, not bad, done."

  rationale: >
    In previous iterations, completed checkmarks were green. This was
    wrong: completing a set is not the same as progressing. A user
    who does the exact same weight and reps as last time has completed
    the set but hasn't progressed. Green should only mean "you did
    better than before." The neutral checkmark respects this distinction.

# =============================================================================
# GRIS — Secondary Information
# =============================================================================
grey_secondary:
  meaning: "Supporting information, not primary data"
  tokens:
    dark_muted: "#5C5C66"
    dark_dimmed: "#2E2E36"
    light_muted: "#76767E"
    light_dimmed: "#C8C8D0"
