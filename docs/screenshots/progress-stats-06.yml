  Fitness dashboard showing "Last 30 days" with stacked cards: a
  GitHub-style activity heatmap calendar (color-coded by activity
  count), an "Activity Summary" card with total hours, date range,
  change indicator, and a line chart, and a "Strain Performance"
  card with percentage value, status label, and a multi-colored
  oscillating chart. Dark theme with well-spaced card layout.

      Each card presents exactly the right amount of information —
      no more, no less. The activity heatmap shows workout frequency
      at a glance. The activity summary card shows total time with a
      trend line and change indicator. The strain card shows a single
      percentage with status. Each card tells one story clearly
      without overwhelming.

      Use this card-per-metric approach for the MaxReps stats
      dashboard. Each card should tell one clear story: workout
      frequency card (heatmap or calendar), volume progression card
      (total volume + trend chart), strength progression card (key
      lifts + line chart), consistency card (streak or completion
      rate). Keep each card focused on a single insight with one
      primary metric, one supporting visualization, and minimal
      secondary text.

    like: >
      The heatmap calendar shows two months side by side with cells
      colored by activity count (grey for none, green shades for 1,
      2, 3+ activities). Includes a legend at the bottom. Gives an
      instant visual sense of training consistency and frequency
      patterns over time.

      Implement a workout frequency heatmap for MaxReps. Display a
      month or two-month calendar grid with cells colored by workout
      count per day. Use our Tamagui accent color at varying opacities
      for intensity levels (none, 1 workout, 2+). Include a simple
      legend. This is a powerful motivation tool for consistency.

    like: >
      The Activity Summary card has a perfect structure: icon + title
      at top, large primary value (22h 0m), date range below, change
      indicator on the right (+5h 39m with up arrow), and a line chart
      taking the bottom half. The arrow link to detailed view is
      unobtrusive. Everything a user needs to understand their trend
      at a glance.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use this card structure as the template for MaxReps stat cards:
      icon + title (top left), detail arrow (top right), large primary
      metric, date range, change indicator with directional arrow and
      value, chart in the lower portion. Apply to: total volume card,
      workout frequency card, estimated 1RM progression card.

takeaway: >
  This is the best stats dashboard reference across all screenshots.
  The cards are perfectly balanced — each one delivers a clear insight
  with just enough data and visualization. The heatmap, the summary
  card structure, and the overall stacked layout should directly
  inform the MaxReps stats dashboard design.

avoid: >
  The multi-colored oscillating chart on the Strain Performance card
  may be confusing without clear axis labels. Ensure MaxReps charts
  always have readable axis labels and tooltips. The "Last 30 days"
  as the only time range visible — MaxReps should offer switchable
  time ranges as seen in other references.
