  Monthly report screen showing personal records section with a trophy
  badge icon ("2 new PRs"), exercise details with PR type (Weight and
  1RM), and a workout days calendar log with streak counter and fire
  icon below.

    like: >
      The PR badge is visually rewarding — a yellow trophy icon with
      "2 new PRs" in bold text. The individual PR details below show
      the exercise name, PR type, and value in accent color. It's a
      clear, celebratory moment that makes achieving a personal record
      feel significant.

      Implement a PR badge/celebration component in MaxReps. When a
      user sets a new personal record, display a prominent badge with
      an icon (trophy or medal), the count of new PRs, and a list of
      specific records broken (exercise name, PR type, value). Use
      accent color for PR values. This should appear in workout
      summaries and monthly/weekly reports. Add a subtle animation
      or haptic when a PR is achieved during a live workout.
    priority: high

takeaway: >
  The PR badge creates a rewarding micro-moment that reinforces
  progressive overload motivation. This is a critical engagement
  feature for a strength training app — celebrating PRs should be
  a first-class experience in MaxReps.

avoid: >
  The calendar log and streak counter below are standard patterns
  but not the focus here. The overall screen layout is functional
  but visually flat — the PR badge itself is the only element worth
  extracting.
