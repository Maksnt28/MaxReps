context: >
  Exercise selection screen for creating a superset or circuit. Lists
  all exercises currently in the workout as individual cards with
  illustration, exercise name, equipment type, set count, and a
  checkbox for selection. A "Create" button at the bottom finalizes
  the grouping.

elements:
  - id: "exercise-selection-card"
    what: "Card-based exercise row with checkbox selection"
    like: >
      Each exercise is presented as a distinct card with clear
      boundaries. The layout is simple: small illustration, exercise
      name (bold), equipment type and set count as secondary text,
      checkbox on the right. Easy to scan and tap. The card separation
      makes each item feel like a discrete, selectable unit.

      Use this card-based selection pattern whenever the user needs
      to pick exercises from a list (superset creation, exercise
      reordering, bulk actions). Each card: exercise name as primary
      text, equipment type • set count as secondary text, checkbox on
      the right. Use Tamagui card tokens with subtle borders for
      separation.
    priority: high

  - id: "exercise-metadata"
    what: "Equipment type and set count as inline secondary info"
    like: >
      Below each exercise name, the equipment type and set count are
      shown on a single line with a dot separator (e.g. "Barbell •
      3 sets"). Compact and informative without taking extra vertical
      space.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Display exercise metadata as a single secondary line using dot
      separators: "Equipment • X sets". Use a muted text color for
      this line to maintain visual hierarchy with the exercise name.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The simplicity of this selection screen is its strength. No
  unnecessary complexity — just a list of exercises with checkboxes.
  The card layout makes each item feel tappable and distinct. This
  pattern works well for any multi-select exercise interaction in
  the app.

avoid: >
  The "Create" button appears greyed out even though no selection has
  been made, which could confuse users about whether the feature is
  available. For MaxReps, clearly differentiate between disabled state
  (no selection) and active state with distinct visual treatment and
  consider adding a selection count to the button label.
