# DESIGN DIRECTION
# =============================================================================
design_direction:
  overall_feel: >
    Monochrome-first. Clean, focused, gym-ready. The interface lives
    in black, grey, silver, and white. Color appears ONLY to carry
    meaning — progression, regression, records, active state. Every
    pixel earns its place. No decoration.
  quality_benchmark: "Commercial App Store quality — Strong and Hevy tier."
  color_philosophy: >
    Color = information, not decoration. The UI is 95% neutral. When
    color appears, it means something specific and the user learns
    this instinctively. Blue = interactive/active. Green = you're
    progressing. Red = attention/regression. Gold = new record.
    White = neutral completion.
  theme:
    primary: "Dark mode"
    secondary: "Light mode (supported, designed second)"
    dark_approach: >
      Never flat black. Subtle gradient from near-black to dark
      charcoal. Cards are transparent glass over the background.
    light_approach: >
      Off-white gradient background. Cards are semi-opaque white
      glass. Same color semantics, adjusted saturation for contrast.

# INNOVATION — WHAT DISTINGUISHES MAXREPS
# =============================================================================
innovation:
  momentum_indicator:
    description: >
      Real-time performance comparison during the active workout.
      A horizontal bar showing +/−% versus the last session. No
      competitor does this. It makes progressive overload visible
      live, not just in post-workout stats.
    placement: "Top of active workout screen, below progress dots"
    priority: high

  contextual_last_session:
    description: >
      Last session values are always visible — as a summary line
      under the exercise name, and as ghost values in parentheses
      on upcoming sets. The user never leaves the logging screen
      to check history. They always know what to beat.
    priority: high

  contextual_cta:
    description: >
      The main action button adapts to context. "Valider · Série
      3/4" during sets. "Terminer l'exercice" on last set.
      "Finir la séance 🎉" on last exercise. Every tap has context.
    priority: high

  progress_dots:
    description: >
      Segmented bar at the top showing completed/remaining exercises.
      Gives a sense of global session progress at a glance.
    priority: medium

# =============================================================================
# INFORMATION DENSITY PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================
information_density:
  principle: >
    Each screen has one primary job. Active workout = logging tool.
    Stats = progress insight. Library = exercise discovery. Never
    mix purposes.
  active_workout: >
    Weight, reps, completion state, and delta vs last session per
    set row. Last session context visible inline. No exercise
    thumbnails, no graphs, no notes inline. Those live elsewhere.
  stats_dashboard: >
    One card = one insight. Each card tells a single story with one
    primary metric, one supporting visualization, and minimal
    secondary text.
  exercise_library: >
    Search first, filters second, then a clean alphabetical list.
    Maximum exercises visible without scrolling.

# =============================================================================
# TYPOGRAPHY
# =============================================================================
typography:
  approach: "Clear hierarchy, large numbers for weight/reps, readable at a glance"
  french_text_note: >
    French text runs ~15-20% longer than English — account for this
    in all layouts, especially buttons, chips, and card titles. Test
    with longest expected French strings.
  number_rendering: >
    All numeric values (weight, reps, timer, stats) use tabular
    numbers (fontVariantNumeric: tabular-nums) to prevent layout
    shift during updates.

# =============================================================================
# SPACING & TOUCH
# =============================================================================
spacing:
  approach: "Generous touch targets (44pt minimum), comfortable density"
  gym_context: >
    Users interact with sweaty hands, often mid-set — fat finger
    tolerance matters. Weight/rep input fields and set completion
    buttons need extra-large touch targets.

# =============================================================================
# MOTION & FEEDBACK
# =============================================================================
motion:
  approach: >
    Subtle, purposeful. Confirm actions, celebrate PRs, nothing
    decorative. Every animation serves a functional purpose.
  haptic_feedback:
    - trigger: "Set completed"
      type: "Light impact"
    - trigger: "PR achieved"
      type: "Success notification + subtle animation"
    - trigger: "Timer expired"
      type: "Strong notification (works when phone is face-down)"
    - trigger: "Weight stepper tap"
      type: "Light impact per step, stronger on long-press"
    - trigger: "Exercise added/removed"
      type: "Light impact"

# KEY INTERACTIONS
# =============================================================================
rest_timer:
  description: >
    Three-tier timer system. In-app default is a compact tinted
    bandeau (not a full card) to save vertical space. Expandable
    to full-screen for distance readability.
  tiers:
    - mode: "Compact bandeau"
      display: "Tinted accent-bg strip inline with workout content"
      behavior: "Default in-app. Countdown, +30s, skip. Minimal height."
      priority: high
    - mode: "Live Activity"
      display: "iOS Live Activities / Dynamic Island"
      behavior: "Visible outside app. Tap to return. Countdown only."
      priority: high
    - mode: "Full-screen"
      display: "Expanded large countdown for distance readability"
      behavior: "Tap to expand from bandeau. Phone on bench use case."
      priority: medium

pr_celebration:
  description: >
    Personal records are a core motivational driver. PR detection
    and celebration should be a first-class experience.
  elements:
    - "Gold accent bar on top of PR card"
    - "Trophy emoji + PR label in gold"
    - "Progress delta in green"
    - "Mini chart showing progression trend"
    - "Haptic success notification"
    - "PR summary in workout completion screen"

# =============================================================================
# GYM CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS
# =============================================================================
gym_context:
  screen_auto_lock: "Prevent auto-lock during active workout session"
  readability: >
    All critical information (weight, reps, timer) must be readable
    at arm's length in both dim and bright gym lighting conditions.
  audio_haptic: >
    Timer expiry must use both haptic and optional audio cue,
    effective when phone is face-down on a bench or in a pocket.
  offline: >
    Aspirational — not Phase 1. CLAUDE.md defines cloud-first,
    online-required architecture. Full offline sync deferred to
    a future phase. Original spec text preserved for reference:
    "Core workout logging must work fully offline. Sync when
    connection is available."

# =============================================================================
# DESIGN PRIORITIES (ordered)
# =============================================================================
priorities:
  - "Speed of logging (minimize taps to complete a set)"
  - "Glanceability (see workout state in <1 second)"
  - "Progressive overload visibility (always show last performance + momentum)"
  - "Gym-proof interactions (sweaty hands, dim lighting, arm's length)"
  - "Celebration of progress (PRs, streaks, volume milestones)"
  - "Contextual intelligence (CTA adapts, last session always visible)"
