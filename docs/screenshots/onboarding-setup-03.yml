  Advanced customization settings screen on a dark theme. A toggle
  enables "Advanced Customisation" which reveals a card containing
  multiple slider controls. Each slider has a bold label, a descriptive
  subtitle, the current value displayed in accent color, and a stepped
  slider track. A "Save" CTA button at the bottom.

  - id: "settings-card"
    what: "Contained card grouping related settings"
    like: >
      All advanced settings are grouped inside a single card container
      with a subtle border, visually communicating that these options
      belong together. The card has a toggle at the top to enable/
      disable the entire group. Clean separation from the rest of the
      screen content.

      Use card containers to group related settings. A master toggle
      at the top of the card can enable/disable the group (e.g.
      "Personnalisation avancée" toggle that reveals progression
      settings, rest timer defaults, or notification preferences).
      Use Tamagui card tokens with a subtle border on dark theme.

  - id: "slider-with-labels"
    what: "Stepped slider with title, description, and current value"
    like: >
      Each slider control has a strong information hierarchy: bold
      parameter name, muted description explaining what it controls,
      and the current selected value displayed in accent color aligned
      to the right. The slider track has visible step markers. The
      overall layout is clean and each parameter is easy to understand
      and adjust.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use this slider pattern for any adjustable numeric settings in
      MaxReps: rest timer defaults, weight increment preferences,
      RPE thresholds. Each slider row: bold label, muted description
      below, current value in accent color on the right, stepped
      slider below. Define step markers for discrete values. Use
      Tamagui accent color tokens for the active value display.

  - id: "dark-theme-presentation"
    what: "Overall dark theme aesthetic with accent highlights"
    like: >
      The dark background with teal/green accent color for active
      values creates a clean, modern look. The card has a subtle
      border that's visible without being heavy. Text hierarchy is
      well-managed with white for primary, grey for secondary, and
      accent for values.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Apply this text hierarchy pattern in MaxReps dark theme:
      white/light for primary labels, muted grey for descriptions,
      accent color for active values and current states. Ensure
      card borders are visible but subtle on dark backgrounds
      using a slightly lighter dark tone.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The overall presentation of settings and configuration options on
  this screen is well-executed. The combination of card grouping,
  clear information hierarchy per parameter, and accent-colored
  values makes complex settings feel approachable. The toggle-to-
  reveal pattern is smart for progressive disclosure.

avoid: >
  The specific teal/green accent color is Runna's brand — use
  MaxReps' own accent color. The slider implementation may need
  haptic feedback at each step to feel premium on mobile.
