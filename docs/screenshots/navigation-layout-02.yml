context: >
  Home/overview screen from WHOOP showing a dark theme with subtle
  gradient tones. Top navigation with day selector, horizontal tab
  bar (Overview, Sleep, Recovery, Strain), a circular data widget,
  an onboarding card with colored border, and a bottom tab bar. A
  floating action button (+) sits in the bottom right corner.

  - id: "dark-theme-gradient"
    what: "Dark background with subtle gradient treatment"
    like: >
      The dark theme uses very subtle gradient shifts rather than a
      flat black background. There are hints of dark blue and charcoal
      that give the screen depth without being distracting. The gradient
      is barely perceptible but makes the interface feel more refined
      and less stark than pure black.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      For MaxReps dark theme, use subtle gradient backgrounds instead
      of flat black. Apply a very slight gradient from dark charcoal
      to near-black, or incorporate faint blue/cool undertones. Define
      these as Tamagui background tokens (e.g. backgroundGradientStart,
      backgroundGradientEnd) for consistency. The gradient should be
      barely noticeable — just enough to add depth.

  - id: "bottom-tab-bar"
    what: "Dark bottom navigation bar with icon + label tabs"
    like: >
      The bottom tab bar blends seamlessly with the dark theme. Icons
      are outlined in inactive state, with the active tab using a
      subtle highlight. The bar itself has a slightly elevated
      background compared to the screen content, creating a natural
      boundary.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Design the MaxReps bottom tab bar to integrate smoothly with
      the dark theme. Use a slightly lighter dark shade for the tab
      bar background to differentiate from screen content. Outlined
      icons for inactive tabs, filled or accent-colored for active.
      Keep labels below icons.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The subtle gradient approach to dark themes is the key insight.
  It elevates a dark interface from feeling flat and cheap to feeling
  refined and premium. This should be the foundation of MaxReps' dark
  mode — never pure flat black, always with a hint of depth through
  barely perceptible gradients.

avoid: >
  The onboarding overlay and tooltip arrow pattern is not relevant.
  The overall screen is quite information-dense with multiple data
  widgets — MaxReps should not replicate this density on its home
  screen.
