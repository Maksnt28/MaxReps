  Home screen showing a temperature control card with stepper buttons,
  phase tabs (Bedtime, Night, Now), and a subtle gradient background.
  Below, an alarms card with toggle and schedule info. Dark theme with
  card-based layout and muted color palette with pinkish gradient
  accents.

    like: >
      The general presentation is appealing — content is organized in
      clear card sections stacked vertically, with comfortable spacing
      between them. The dark theme uses subtle gradient washes inside
      cards that add visual interest without being distracting. The
      stepper control (+/- buttons with large central value) is clean
      and satisfying. The uppercase spaced-letter section headers
      (TEMPERATURE, ALARMS) create a refined, premium feel.

      Reference this screen for overall dark theme card layout polish.
      Cards with subtle internal gradient or tinted backgrounds can
      add depth to key sections. Consider uppercase letter-spaced
      section headers as an option for card titles in the MaxReps
      design system. The stepper pattern (large value with +/- buttons)
      is relevant for weight increment controls.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  A general layout reference for dark theme card presentation. The
  subtle gradient wash inside cards and the uppercase section headers
  contribute to a premium aesthetic. The stepper interaction pattern
  is noted for potential reuse in weight/rep input controls.

avoid: >
  The font choice on this screen is not appealing — do not replicate
  the typography. The pinkish gradient tint is brand-specific to
  Eight Sleep and should not be carried over. MaxReps should use its
  own accent color tokens for any card gradient treatments.
