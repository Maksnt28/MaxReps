context: >
  Muscle group selection/filter screen. Lists muscle groups organized
  by body region (Upper Body, Core visible). Each row shows an
  anatomical thumbnail highlighting the specific muscle area, the
  muscle name, and a checkbox. Three groups selected (Chest, Shoulders,
  Triceps). A "Select 3" CTA button at the bottom updates dynamically
  with the selection count.

  - id: "muscle-filter-list"
    what: "Muscle group filter with visual thumbnails and checkboxes"
    like: >
      Each muscle group row pairs a small anatomical illustration
      highlighting the specific muscles with the group name and a
      checkbox. The visual makes it immediately clear which body area
      each group refers to — no ambiguity. The illustrations are
      consistent in style, using highlighted zones on a body outline.

      Implement a muscle group filter screen with this exact pattern:
      anatomical thumbnail on the left highlighting the specific muscle
      area, group name as primary text, checkbox on the right. Use our
      Tamagui color tokens to tint the highlighted muscle zone. Group
      the list by body region (Upper Body, Lower Body, Core).

  - id: "section-headers"
    what: "Body region section grouping (Upper Body, Core)"
    like: >
      Muscle groups are organized under clear section headers by body
      region. Simple and logical hierarchy that makes scanning the
      full list fast.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Group muscle filters by body region with sticky section headers:
      Upper Body, Lower Body, Core. Use bold section titles consistent
      with our typography scale.

  - id: "dynamic-cta"
    what: "Bottom button showing selection count"
    like: >
      The "Select 3" button at the bottom dynamically reflects the
      number of selected items. Clear feedback on current state without
      needing to count checkboxes manually.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use a sticky bottom CTA button that updates its label dynamically
      based on selection count (e.g. "Filter by 3 muscle groups"). Disable
      the button when no selection is made.

takeaway: >
  The combination of visual muscle thumbnails with a checkbox list is
  the ideal pattern for muscle group filtering. It removes all ambiguity
  about which muscles belong to which group, especially for beginner
  users who may not know anatomy terminology. The body region sectioning
  adds useful structure without complexity.

avoid: >
  The dark theme with yellow accent checkboxes is Peloton-specific —
  do not replicate this color scheme. The anatomical illustrations here
  are somewhat dark and low-contrast on the dark background. Our version
  should ensure strong contrast between the highlighted muscle zones and
  the background regardless of theme.
