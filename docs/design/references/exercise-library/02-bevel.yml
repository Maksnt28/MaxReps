context: >
  Exercise library modal with a search bar at the top, two filter
  chips ("All groups", "All equipment"), alphabetical section index,
  and a scrollable list of exercises. Each exercise row shows a small
  illustration, exercise name, equipment type, and action icons (info
  and link/add). Arnold Press is currently selected (link icon filled).

elements:
  - id: "search-bar"
    what: "Search input at the top of the library"
    like: >
      The search bar is prominently placed at the very top, immediately
      accessible. Simple magnifying glass icon with placeholder text.
      No unnecessary decoration — just a clean input field ready for
      typing.

      Place a search bar at the top of the exercise library screen.
      Keep it simple: magnifying glass icon, placeholder text
      "Rechercher un exercice". Search should filter results in
      real-time as the user types.

  - id: "filter-chips"
    what: "Horizontal filter chips for muscle group and equipment"
    like: >
      Two compact filter chips sit just below the search bar: "All
      groups" and "All equipment". They act as dropdown triggers with
      a filter icon prefix and chevron suffix. Clean and space-efficient
      way to expose filtering without cluttering the UI.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Add horizontal filter chips below the search bar for muscle group
      and equipment type. Each chip acts as a dropdown/modal trigger.
      Show the active filter value in the chip label (e.g. "Chest" or
      "Barbell" when filtered, "All groups" when unfiltered). Use our
      Tamagui chip component tokens for consistent styling.

  - id: "exercise-row"
    what: "Exercise list row with name, equipment, and illustration"
    like: >
      Each row is clean and consistent: small illustration on the left,
      exercise name as primary text, equipment type as secondary text
      below. The layout is simple and highly scannable across a long
      list. Alphabetical ordering with section letter headers helps
      navigation.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use this row layout for the exercise library list. Each row:
      small thumbnail or icon on the left, exercise name (bold) as
      primary text, equipment type as secondary text below. Sort
      alphabetically with sticky letter section headers. Keep rows
      compact to maximize visible exercises without scrolling.
    priority: high

takeaway: >
  This is a well-structured exercise library with the right hierarchy:
  search first, filters second, then a clean alphabetical list. The
  simplicity of the display makes browsing hundreds of exercises
  manageable. The combination of search + filter chips covers both
  users who know what they're looking for and those who want to browse.

avoid: >
  The exercise illustrations in the rows are very small and hard to
  read at this size. For MaxReps, either make thumbnails larger and
  more legible or replace them with simple muscle group color indicators
  (chips or dots) which convey the same information more efficiently
  at small sizes.
