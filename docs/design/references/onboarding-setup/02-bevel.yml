context: >
  Onboarding screen asking "What is your training goal?" with a
  descriptive subtitle explaining the purpose. Four goal options
  presented as card-style rows with an icon, title, description,
  and checkmark for the selected option. "Get stronger" is currently
  selected. A "Save and continue" CTA at the bottom with a reassurance
  note about updating later.

elements:
  - id: "narrative-header"
    what: "Question title with explanatory subtitle"
    like: >
      The screen leads with a clear, bold question followed by a
      softer subtitle that explains why this choice matters ("The
      result you're working toward, shaping your exercises, effort,
      and progress"). This narrative approach gives the user context
      and motivation to answer thoughtfully. The screen feels
      purposeful rather than just data collection.

      Use this narrative header pattern for all MaxReps onboarding
      screens. Each step should have: a bold question as the primary
      heading, then a subtitle in muted text explaining why the answer
      matters or how it will be used. This builds trust and helps the
      user understand the value of providing information. Translate to
      French: heading as a direct question, subtitle as a brief
      contextual explanation.

  - id: "goal-option-cards"
    what: "Selectable card rows with icon, title, and description"
    like: >
      Each option is a full-width card with an icon on the left, a
      bold title, and a short description below. The selected option
      has a visible checkmark and a distinct border. The cards are
      generous in size, making them easy to tap. The layout is clean
      and succinct — only four options, no scrolling needed.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use card-style selectable rows for single-choice onboarding
      questions. Each card: icon on the left, bold title, one-line
      description in muted text, checkmark on the right when selected.
      Selected state uses accent border or subtle background fill.
      Keep options to 3-5 maximum per screen to avoid scrolling.

  - id: "reassurance-note"
    what: "Small text below CTA noting responses can be changed later"
    like: >
      The note "All responses are saved and can be updated anytime in
      Advanced Settings" reduces commitment anxiety. Users are more
      likely to proceed quickly knowing their choices aren't permanent.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Add a reassurance note below the CTA on onboarding screens:
      "Vous pourrez modifier vos réponses à tout moment dans les
      paramètres." Keep it small and muted. This reduces friction
      and encourages faster completion of the onboarding flow.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  This is the strongest onboarding pattern seen so far. The narrative
  approach — question + context + clear options + reassurance — creates
  a flow that feels guided and purposeful rather than like a cold form.
  The screen is slightly sparse but this is a feature, not a bug: it
  keeps focus on the single decision at hand.

avoid: >
  The screen feels a bit empty due to generous vertical spacing. For
  MaxReps, maintain the clarity but tighten spacing slightly to feel
  more balanced. Do not add content just to fill space — the focused,
  one-question-per-screen approach is correct for high-impact choices
  like training goals.
