context: >
  Collections screen showing a vertical list of large, full-width
  image cards. Each card has rounded corners, a collection title,
  category tags with colored dots, and a class count badge. Cards
  are stacked vertically with consistent spacing between them.

elements:
  - id: "card-shape-and-radius"
    what: "Large full-width cards with generous rounded corners"
    like: >
      The cards have a perfect shape — large corner radius (appears
      to be ~16-20px), full width with comfortable side margins, and
      a generous height that gives each card visual weight and
      presence. The rounded corners are pronounced enough to feel
      modern and soft without being exaggerated.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use this card shape as the primary reference for MaxReps content
      cards. Large corner radius (~16-20px via Tamagui borderRadius
      tokens), full width minus horizontal screen margins (~16px each
      side). Cards should have enough height to feel substantial.
      Apply this to program cards, workout overview cards, and any
      primary content containers.

  - id: "card-spacing"
    what: "Consistent vertical spacing between stacked cards"
    like: >
      The gap between cards is well-calibrated — enough to clearly
      separate each card as its own unit but not so much that the
      screen feels sparse. The spacing is consistent throughout the
      list, creating a steady rhythm as you scroll.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Define a consistent card gap token in Tamagui (e.g. cardGap or
      spacing.cardList) of approximately 16-20px. Apply this uniformly
      across all vertically stacked card lists in the app: program
      lists, workout history, exercise lists. Consistency in spacing
      is critical for the app's visual rhythm.

  - id: "card-content-overlay"
    what: "Text content overlaid on card with category dots"
    like: >
      The title and metadata are overlaid directly on the card image
      with good contrast. Category tags use small colored dots as
      prefixes — a subtle and space-efficient way to show categories
      without chips or badges.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Consider overlaid text on program cards where background images
      are used. Ensure contrast with a gradient overlay or semi-
      transparent background behind text. The colored dot prefix for
      categories is a good alternative to full chips when space is
      limited — evaluate for program tag display.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The card shape and spacing on this screen set a gold standard for
  card-based layouts. The generous corner radius, consistent gaps,
  and full-width proportions create a visual rhythm that feels both
  modern and premium. These exact proportions and spacing values
  should form the baseline of the MaxReps card design system.

avoid: >
  The image-heavy card style with background photos works for a
  content/class platform but may not suit MaxReps' data-focused
  cards. Do not default to image backgrounds on workout or program
  cards — use solid colors or subtle gradients from our design
  tokens instead. The overlaid text approach requires careful
  contrast management and can fail with inconsistent imagery.
