context: >
  Rewards/travel screen from Alipay showing a prominent card component
  with rounded corners, taking up most of the screen width. A small
  header label sits above the card. Below, tabbed content with
  horizontal category chips and promotional cards.

elements:
  - id: "card-shape"
    what: "Large rounded card with generous proportions"
    like: >
      The card has well-balanced proportions — large rounded corners,
      generous padding, and takes up almost the full screen width with
      comfortable side margins. It feels substantial without being
      cramped. The card sits below a small contextual header, creating
      a clean visual hierarchy.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use this card proportion as reference for primary content cards
      in MaxReps (workout summaries, program overviews). Full width
      minus consistent horizontal margins, generous corner radius
      (16-20px), comfortable internal padding. Cards should feel
      spacious and prominent on screen.
    priority: high

  - id: "card-header"
    what: "Small header label above the main card"
    like: >
      A subtle header sits above the card, providing context without
      competing for attention. The hierarchy is clear: small label
      above, large card below. This pattern anchors the card in its
      section.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use small section header labels above primary cards to provide
      context (e.g. "Programme actif", "Dernière séance", "Prochaine
      séance"). Keep headers in a smaller, muted font weight to
      maintain focus on the card content below.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The card proportions and spacing set the tone for the entire screen.
  A well-sized card with generous corner radius and proper margins
  creates a premium feel. The small header above provides just enough
  context without visual clutter.

avoid: >
  The busy interior of this specific card (3D illustrations, gradient
  backgrounds, multiple CTAs) is too cluttered. MaxReps cards should
  maintain the exterior proportions but keep internal content clean
  and minimal.
