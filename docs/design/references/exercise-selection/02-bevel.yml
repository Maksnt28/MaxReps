context: >
  Exercise library modal with active search for "Lunge". Shows search
  bar, two filter chips (All groups, All equipment), a "Custom" section
  with "Add custom exercise" option, then filtered results organized
  alphabetically. Each exercise row has an illustration, name, equipment
  type, info button, and add/selected toggle. "Lunge - Bodyweight" is
  currently selected (checkmark).

elements:

    what: "Complete exercise library with search, filters, and list"
    like: >
      The overall layout is clean and well-structured: search bar at
      top, filter chips below, then the exercise list. The hierarchy
      is clear and the flow is intuitive — type to search, optionally
      filter, then browse or select. Everything a user needs is on one
      screen with no hidden navigation.

      Adopt this full layout pattern for the MaxReps exercise selection
      modal. Top-to-bottom hierarchy: search bar (with accent-colored
      icon), filter chips (muscle group + equipment), custom exercise
      option, then alphabetical exercise list. Present as a modal or
      full-screen sheet.

  - id: "filter-system"
    what: "Filter chips for muscle group and equipment"
    like: >
      The two filter chips ("All groups", "All equipment") are compact
      and non-intrusive. They work in combination with the search bar
      to progressively narrow results. The dropdown chevron makes it
      clear they open a sub-selection.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Implement combinable filter chips for muscle group and equipment
      type. Filters should work alongside the search query — all three
      (search + group + equipment) narrow results simultaneously. Show
      active filter value in the chip label when a filter is applied.

  - id: "add-select-toggle"
    what: "Plus button that becomes a checkmark when selected"
    like: >
      Each exercise row has a "+" button to add and it toggles to a
      filled checkmark when selected. The state change is clear and
      immediate. Simple single-tap interaction — no confirmation
      needed.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use a toggle button on each exercise row: "+" icon in default
      state, filled checkmark in selected state. Single tap to add,
      single tap to remove. Provide haptic feedback on state change.
      Selected exercises should be visually distinct (filled icon with
      accent background).
    priority: high

  - id: "custom-exercise-option"
    what: "Add custom exercise entry at the top of results"
    like: >
      The "Add custom exercise" option is placed in its own "Custom"
      section above the alphabetical list. Easy to find but not
      intrusive. Solves the case where the user's exercise isn't in
      the library.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Include an "Ajouter un exercice personnalisé" option at the top
      of the exercise library, in its own section above the main list.
      Use a "+" icon to differentiate it from regular exercise rows.
      Tapping opens a creation form (name, muscle group, equipment).
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  This is the most complete exercise selection pattern seen so far.
  The combination of search + filters + alphabetical list + custom
  exercise creation covers all user scenarios: knowing exactly what
  you want, browsing by category, and creating something new. The
  simplicity of the layout keeps it fast despite the feature density.

avoid: >
  The exercise illustrations remain small and hard to distinguish at
  this size. For MaxReps, consider whether thumbnails add enough value
  in the selection view or if muscle group color indicators would be
  more effective and space-efficient.
