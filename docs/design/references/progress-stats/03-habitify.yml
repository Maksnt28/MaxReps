context: >
  Progress screen showing multiple card sections: a line chart with
  weekly data points, a check-in time bar chart, habit streak grids
  (Read Book, Run), and a daily performance section. Light theme with
  blue accent color and card containers with left border accents.

elements:
  - id: "progress-bars"
    what: "Simple progress/streak grid bars"
    like: >
      Basic progress visualization with grid-style streak bars showing
      daily completion. Simple and functional.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Note this as a basic reference for streak/consistency
      visualization. The pattern is too simple for MaxReps — our
      progress indicators should convey more information (volume,
      intensity, not just completion).
    priority: low

takeaway: >
  A minimal progress visualization reference. The simplicity is noted
  but MaxReps needs richer data representation for strength training
  progress. This screen serves mainly as a baseline of what to exceed
  in terms of information depth.

avoid: >
  The overall presentation is too simple and lacks the visual polish
  needed for MaxReps. The card borders on the left feel dated. The
  charts are basic and lack interactivity cues. MaxReps progress
  screens should be significantly more refined and data-rich than
  this example.
