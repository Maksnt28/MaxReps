context: >
  Net worth analytics screen with a tab bar (Summary, Assets, Debt),
  a main card showing total assets with a line chart and time range
  selector (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y), followed by goal cards with progress
  bars showing completion percentage.

elements:
  - id: "analytics-layout"
    what: "Overall analytics page structure with tabs, chart card, and goal cards"
    like: >
      The general presentation is well-structured: a top-level tab
      bar for switching between views, a primary card with the key
      metric in large text plus a chart below, time range selectors
      as pill buttons, and secondary cards below for detailed
      breakdowns. The hierarchy flows naturally from overview to
      detail.

      Use this layout structure for MaxReps progress/stats screens.
      Top: tab bar or segmented control to switch between stat views
      (e.g. Volume, Strength, Frequency). Primary card: key metric
      in large bold text with a chart below. Time range selector as
      pill buttons (1S for 1 semaine, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1A). Secondary
      cards below for per-exercise or per-muscle-group breakdowns.
    priority: high

  - id: "chart-card"
    what: "Main metric card with line chart and time range selector"
    like: >
      The primary card prominently displays the total value in large
      bold text, with a clean line chart below showing the trend over
      time. The time range pill selector (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y) sits inside
      the card, making it clear it controls this specific chart. The
      area fill under the line is subtle and adds depth.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Implement a chart card component for MaxReps stats. Large metric
      value at top (e.g. total volume, estimated 1RM), line or area
      chart showing progression over time, time range pills inside the
      card. Use a subtle area fill under the line in accent color with
      low opacity. Chart should be interactive — tap to see specific
      data points.
    priority: high

  - id: "header-structure"
    what: "Page title with tab navigation below"
    like: >
      The "Net Worth" title sits prominently at the top with tab
      navigation directly below. Clean separation between the page
      title and the content sections. The tab bar has a clear active
      indicator.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use a similar header structure for the MaxReps stats page:
      bold page title ("Progression" or "Statistiques"), followed by
      a tab bar or segmented control for switching between stat
      categories. Active tab should have a clear underline indicator
      in accent color.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The overall analytics layout is the key reference — the hierarchy
  from page title to tabs to chart card to detail cards creates a
  clear information architecture for progress tracking. The chart
  card with time range selector is directly applicable to MaxReps
  strength progression charts.

avoid: >
  The red/pink header color is brand-specific to Rocket Money — do
  not replicate. The progress bar cards at the bottom are a savings
  app pattern and not directly transferable to fitness tracking.
