  Analytics dashboard on dark theme showing a main "Spent" card with
  bar chart and average line, two half-width cards (Income, Net
  cashflow) with mini bar charts and colored status indicators, and
  a "Budget" section with progress bar and percentage remaining. All
  cards use semi-transparent backgrounds.

elements:
  - id: "transparent-cards"
    what: "Semi-transparent card backgrounds on dark theme"
    like: >
      The cards use a semi-transparent dark background that lets the
      underlying screen color subtly show through. This creates depth
      and layering without harsh borders. The transparency makes the
      cards feel integrated into the page rather than floating on top
      of it. Combined with the dark theme, it produces a refined,
      modern aesthetic.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Implement semi-transparent card backgrounds for stats/analytics
      cards in MaxReps dark theme. Use rgba backgrounds with low
      opacity (e.g. rgba(255,255,255,0.05) to rgba(255,255,255,0.08))
      instead of solid dark card fills. Define this as a Tamagui token
      (e.g. cardBackgroundTransparent). This adds depth and premium
      feel to the stats dashboard without adding visual weight.

  - id: "card-grid-layout"
    what: "Mix of full-width and half-width stat cards"
    like: >
      The layout mixes a full-width primary card (Spent) with two
      half-width secondary cards (Income, Net cashflow) below. This
      grid creates visual variety and clear hierarchy — the primary
      metric gets more space while secondary metrics sit side by side.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use a mixed card grid for MaxReps stats dashboard: primary
      metric as full-width card (e.g. total volume or key lift
      progression), secondary metrics as half-width cards side by
      side (e.g. workout frequency, average session duration, PRs
      this month). This layout works well to establish information
      hierarchy without scrolling.

  - id: "inline-mini-charts"
    what: "Small bar charts embedded directly in stat cards"
    like: >
      Each card contains a small inline chart that provides trend
      context alongside the numeric value. The charts are compact
      but legible, with the current period highlighted in white/accent
      against muted previous periods. The average dashed line on the
      Spent card adds useful reference context.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Embed mini trend charts (sparklines or small bar charts) inside
      stat cards to provide visual context alongside numeric values.
      Highlight the current period. Consider adding reference lines
      (average, target) where relevant. Keep charts compact — they
      support the number, not replace it.

takeaway: >
  The semi-transparent card treatment on dark theme is the primary
  takeaway. It creates a sophisticated layered aesthetic that should
  define MaxReps' stats dashboard. The mixed card grid and inline
  mini charts are secondary but valuable patterns. The specific
  metrics to display in MaxReps stats cards need further definition
  but the visual framework from this screen is the reference.

avoid: >
  The specific financial metrics and color-coding (green for positive,
  red for negative) are domain-specific. MaxReps should define its
  own semantic colors for progress indicators (e.g. green for PR,
  accent for improvement, muted for maintenance). Do not over-fill
  cards with data — maintain the clean balance seen here.
