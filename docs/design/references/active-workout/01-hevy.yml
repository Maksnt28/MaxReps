context: >
  Workout completion screen showing a shareable summary card for a
  "Leg day" session. The card lists all exercises with set counts,
  equipment type in parentheses, and two anatomical body illustrations
  (front/back) highlighting the muscles worked. Share options are
  displayed below the card.

elements:
  - id: "summary-card"
    what: "Dark rounded card with workout overview"
    like: >
      The card layout is clean and minimal — workout name as a bold
      heading, then a simple list of exercises with set count on the
      left in accent color. The entire summary fits on one card with
      no scrolling needed. Great information density.

      Adopt the card-based layout as a core design pattern across
      the app. Use rounded containers with subtle elevation or
      background contrast. Workout summaries should fit on a single
      card: session name as heading, exercises listed with set count
      prefix in accent color, equipment type as secondary info.

  - id: "exercise-list-format"
    what: "Compact exercise list with colored set count"
    like: >
      Each exercise is one line: colored set count (e.g. "4x") followed
      by exercise name and equipment in parentheses. Extremely scannable,
      no unnecessary details. Minimalist presentation.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use this compact format for workout summary views. Set count as
      a colored prefix, exercise name, equipment type in parentheses.
      One line per exercise, no thumbnails or extra metadata in this
      view.

    what: "Anatomical body figures showing muscles worked"
    like: >
      The concept of visually indicating which muscles were targeted
      during the session is very informative. Front and back body views
      with highlighted muscle groups give an instant visual summary.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Implement muscle group visualization on workout summaries, but
      replace the 3D anatomical figure with a cleaner, more stylized
      illustration that fits our design language. Use flat/vector-style
      body outlines with colored overlays matching our Tamagui muscle
      group color tokens.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The card-based layout is the key takeaway here. It's clean, minimal,
  and instantly readable. The card pattern should become a foundational
  UI element across the entire MaxReps app — for summaries, program
  overviews, and anywhere grouped information needs to be displayed.
  The muscle visualization concept is valuable but needs a better
  visual execution.

avoid: >
  The 3D anatomical body illustration style feels dated and out of
  place in a modern mobile UI. Replace with a flat, stylized
  alternative. The font choice on this screen is not appealing —
  use a more modern typeface that aligns with our design system.
