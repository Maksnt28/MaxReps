  Full-screen timer display showing "Timer / 3 Minutes" as context
  in the top left, a close button (X) top right, large centered
  countdown digits (02:57), and a minimal pause button at the bottom.
  Pure black background with white text — maximum simplicity.

    like: >
      The timer is stripped to its absolute essentials: large centered
      countdown, pause button, close button, and a label showing the
      total duration. Nothing else. The simplicity makes it readable
      from across a gym. The full-screen mode could work as an
      expanded view when the user wants maximum visibility.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Offer a full-screen expanded timer mode as an option. When the
      user taps to expand from the compact or card timer, show a
      full-screen view with: large centered countdown digits, pause
      button, close/minimize button, +30s and skip buttons, and the
      current exercise name as context. This mode is useful when the
      phone is propped up on a bench and needs to be readable from
      distance. Consider adding the option to expand the compact
      timer into this full-screen view.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The full-screen timer serves as the maximum-visibility mode in a
  three-tier timer system for MaxReps: compact (pill/Dynamic Island)
  → card (bottom sheet overlay) → full-screen (expanded for distance
  readability). Offering all three modes gives users flexibility
  based on their gym setup.

avoid: >
  The full-screen mode should not be the default — it blocks all
  workout content. It should only be available as an explicit
  expansion option. The pause button design is too minimal and
  could be hard to tap with sweaty hands — use a larger touch
  target.
