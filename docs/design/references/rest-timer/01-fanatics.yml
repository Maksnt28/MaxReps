  Live stream countdown timer displayed as a floating overlay card
  with semi-transparent dark background. Shows "Show starts Today -
  7:00 PM" as context, large countdown digits (04:05:21) with unit
  labels (hrs, min, sec), and a "Saved" action button below. The
  timer card does not take up the full screen — content is visible
  behind it.

    what: "Semi-transparent timer overlay that doesn't fill the screen"
    like: >
      The timer displays as a contained card with a semi-transparent
      background, floating over the main content. It provides the
      countdown information without blocking the entire screen. The
      transparency effect creates visual depth and keeps the user
      connected to the underlying content.

      Implement the rest timer as a floating card overlay — not a
      full-screen takeover. Use a semi-transparent dark background
      (rgba) so the workout content beneath remains partially visible.
      The timer should be dismissible/collapsible while still counting
      down. Present as a bottom sheet or floating card that the user
      can interact with without losing context of their workout.

    what: "Large countdown digits with unit labels"
    like: >
      The large digits with small unit labels below (hrs, min, sec)
      are readable at a glance from distance — important for a gym
      context where the phone might not be in hand.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Use large, high-contrast countdown digits for the rest timer.
      Include unit labels (min, sec) below the numbers. Digits should
      be readable from arm's length. Use a monospaced or tabular
      number font to prevent layout shift during countdown.
    priority: high

takeaway: >
  The non-full-screen, transparent overlay approach is the key insight
  for the MaxReps rest timer. Users in a gym need to see their timer
  while still being able to reference their workout data. The floating
  card pattern achieves this balance.

avoid: >
  The font weight is too bold/heavy for the countdown digits. MaxReps
  should use a lighter but still legible weight for the timer numbers.
  The overall card is slightly too large — for a rest timer (typically
  just minutes and seconds), it can be more compact.
