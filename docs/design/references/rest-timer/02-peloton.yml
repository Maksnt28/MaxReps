context: >
  Active workout screen for a "60 min Full Body Strength" session.
  Timer displayed at top left showing 2:45 in large text, with stop
  and pause buttons to the right. Below, a progress indicator (0/7
  Blocks as segmented bar), followed by a scrollable exercise list
  with thumbnails, names, and durations. "Swipe to complete" CTA at
  the bottom.

elements:
  - id: "header-timer"
    what: "Timer displayed in the top header area of the screen"
    like: >
      The timer sits in the header area at the top left, always
      visible while the exercise list scrolls below. It's prominent
      enough to read at a glance but doesn't dominate the screen.
      The placement keeps the timer accessible while the main content
      area is dedicated to the exercise list.
    apply_to_maxreps: >
      Consider a header-positioned timer as one display mode for the
      MaxReps rest timer. When the timer is in compact mode, it sits
      in the top area of the active workout screen, always visible
      while the user scrolls through sets. The timer should not
      interfere with set logging interactions below.
    priority: medium

takeaway: >
  The header-positioned timer demonstrates that a timer can be
  always-visible without taking dedicated screen space. This is
  useful as a compact/minimized state for the MaxReps rest timer.

avoid: >
  The stop and pause button styling (square stop, red circle pause)
  is functional but visually unappealing. The exercise list with
  photo thumbnails takes too much vertical space per item. The font
  styling overall is not attractive.
